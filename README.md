## Summary

In this paper we explore how habitat loss and subsequent recovery influences behavior of a community of butterflyfishes.

We found that the aggression of butterflyfishes declined immediately following the habitat loss, followed by a gradual recovery over time. Importantly, we found that this recovery of behavjour closely tracked the recovery of their most important coral resource, Acropora corals:

Boxplots depict median, interquartile range (25-75th percentile), and whiskers include values within 1.5 x interquartile range. Black dot and bar on boxplots depict mean coral cover ±SEM. Letters denote groupings from Tukey’s post-hoc pair-wise comparisons, with similar letters denotating non-significant differences. White values are number of encounters. b) The probability of an encounter (i.e. fish \<1 m apart) between two fish having an aggressive outcome (i.e. a chase or display). Probabilities have been log transformed to enable visualisation, so that a value of 0 represents a focal follow where 100% of encounters had an aggressive outcome, and a value of -1 (or inf) indicates a focal follow with 0 aggressive interactions. Black dot and bar on boxplots depict mean coral cover ± SEM, while boxplots depict median, interquartile range (25-75th percentile), and whiskers include values within 1.5 xinterquartile range. Dashed line marks the mass coral bleaching event.](figures/Figure%202.png)

In order to tease apart whether these behavioural effects may be due to altered behavior, or because more aggressive individuals had simply been removed from the population, we also explore how the butterflyfish community changed over time.

We found weak evidence for a restructuring of the butterflyfish community (a), however this was driven by rare species. If we focus on the five most commons species, or look at feeding guilds (b) there is no evidence for a chnge in the relative abundance of butterflyfish species.

This suggests that the community of butterflyfish altered their behaviour to conserve energy during hard times, and were then able to recover these behaviours as resources recovered.

The five most common species in each year are highlighted and labelled with species names. b) relative abundance of the three main feeding guilds of butterflyfish present on Iriomote I. reefs, c) principal component analysis of butterflyfish community structure. Dashed lined indicates the mass coral bleaching event.](figures/Figure%203.png)

We conclude that while this community of coral reef fishes may have weathered the storm by reducing their aggression, this is not a good news story. First, this strategy is not available to species with limited behavioural flexibility. Second, this system recovered relatively rapidly, however with increasing frequency and severity of disturbances affecting coral reefs, full recovery is increasingly unlikely.
